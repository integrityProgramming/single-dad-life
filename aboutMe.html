                Hi, I'm Geoff an aspiring web developer and the father of 3 beautiful children; one of which 
                passed in October 2009, a son who was born in 2013 and is autistic, and a beautiful daaughter 
                who was born in 2015; and as of the title of this blog says I am a newly single father. Keep 
                in mind I am not a single father because of a custody battle or anything like that, but I am a 
                single father because their mother passed away.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little bit about on the south side of Chicago. I have an associates degree in cyber security, 
                a Bachelors degree in computer science, and a Masters degree in computer science. I have a passion 
                for all things that lead to knowledge, which I try to instill on my children every chance that I 
                get.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have decided to create this blog for  few reasons first I think that it will be theraputic for 
                me to talk about the trials and tribulations of raising mixed children. Oh, did I forget to mention 
                that? And, I also feel that it may be a good guide for someone else who is going through the same 
                set of circumstances
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me also state that this is a predicamint that I never thought that I would be in, therefore I am 
                working through learning as I go, with the social services and such. I also am trying to keep
                in the forefront of my mind that my children will need some form of therapy as they are going through
                their individual coping strategies, and with that being said I am more then likely create 3 different
                posts to introduce my family one for Shanda (the mother of my children), one for Kelan (my son), and
                last but not least one for Kassidy (the baby of the family). Another thing that is worth mentioning
                is that I am also the caregiver for my mother who suffers from frontal lobe dimmentia, which as you 
                can probably imagine adds a completely new level of difficulty to the equation.
